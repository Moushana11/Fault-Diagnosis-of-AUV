# Fault-Diagnosis-of-AUV

## Description
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are critical in underwater exploration, surveillance, and research. However, their reliability is paramount to ensure mission success and safety. This project aims to develop a robust fault diagnosis system for AUVs using advanced machine learning techniques to detect and classify various faults that may occur during operation. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moushana11/Fault_Diagnosis_of_AUV.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fault-Diagnosis-of-AUV
   ```

### Setting Up Your Branch
Before you start making changes, ensure you're working on your own branch:
1. Checkout to your branch (replace "yourname" with your actual branch name):
   ```bash
   git checkout yourname
   ```
   If your branch does not exist, create it and switch to it:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b yourname
   ```

### Running the Notebook
To run the notebook and see the prediction models in action, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the `Fault_Diagnosis_AUV.ipynb` notebook in the browser and run the cells sequentially to see the results.

### Contributing to the Repository
To contribute to the Rainfall Prediction project, follow these steps to push your changes:
1. Stage the changes for commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"
   ```
3. Push the changes to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin yourname
   ```
